## Context & Solution

During the hackathon, several challenges have been presented to us. We chose the one about the small Wallonian city of Antoing, where the locals tend to go shopping, find entertainement and use different services in other bigger cities and don't have any feeling of belonging to their hometown. 

Our solution: with the open data made available to us, we wanted to create a dynamic web app that would easily show the local stores and restaurants. In the future, we want to extend that to cultural sites, entertainment, administration services and so on. But the key feature in this project is the chat bot powered by AI that we implemented. Indeed, Franklin (that's the name of our bot) makes choosing a place to got much easier and faster. It also has a random option generating you a random restaurant if you don't know what you feel like eating.
